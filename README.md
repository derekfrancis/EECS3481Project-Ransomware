# EECS3481Project-Ransomware

We built a little ransomware for the EECS3481 Applied Cryptography class. We implement various symmetric and asymmetric algorithms to decrypt/encrypt files on a computer.
The symmetric algorithms include xor, aes, blowfish, and rc4. 
The asymmetric algorithms include rsa and ecc.

In order to run it, you need to run it through the main file first. The commands available are folder, type, secrets, encrypt and decrypt.
In order to successfully run this program, you have to use this following command order -  folder > type > secrets > encrypt > decrypt.
Once you are on the encryption stage and once the encryption is complete simply type "decrypt" to decrypt the content of that folder. 
In order to supply a folder location to the folder command, simply put in the complete file path of the folder. 
In order to select a specific encryption algortihm,( ie rc4, aes, rsa, blowfish, xor, ecc), simply follow the instructions on the screen. 
In order to use the secrets command, type in a string of your choice.
The encrypt/decrypt commands are straight forward.
